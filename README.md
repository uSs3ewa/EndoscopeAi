# EndoscopeAi

**Interactive support tool for endoscopic surveys**  
for Pirogov Clinic of High Medical Technologies at St Petersburg University

## Overview  
This application is designed to support doctors during endoscopic examinations.  
It helps to efficiently capture and annotate videos and images, record and structure findings, and use AI for real-time or post-procedure analysis.

## AI-powered features  
The app integrates advanced AI technologies, including YOLO (You Only Look Once), to assist medical professionals by:
- Providing real-time image recognition and anomaly detection during endoscopic procedures  
- Assisting with annotation and classification of findings  
- Enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing review time
- Continuously improving models based on collected data and feedback

## Development

### Kanban board
The team tracks work using a [GitHub Project board](https://github.com/uSs3ewa/EndoscopeBETA/projects/1).
Issues move across the following columns:

| Column | Entry criteria |
| ------ | -------------- |
| **Backlog** | Newly created issues or feature ideas. |
| **Ready** | Prioritized tasks ready for development. |
| **In Progress** | Work is actively being done on the issue. |
| **Review** | A pull request is open and awaiting approvals. |
| **Done** | The pull request is merged and the issue closed. |

### Git workflow
Our workflow is adapted from GitHub flow:

1. Create an issue using the templates under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`.
2. Label and assign the issue.
3. Create a feature branch from `main` named `issue-<number>-short-desc`.
4. Commit changes using the `type(scope): summary` format.
5. Open a pull request using `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
6. At least one reviewer must approve before merging.
7. Merge the pull request after CI passes and close the linked issue.

See the [Git workflow diagram source](docs/git_workflow.mmd) for a visual overview.

![Git workflow](docs/git_workflow.svg)

We use GitHub issue templates to track work. For bugs please use `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` and for new features use `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md` when opening issues.

### Secrets management
Secrets such as API keys or credentials should be stored in environment variables or provided through Flutter/Dart `--dart-define` parameters and in GitHub Actions secrets.
`.env` or other files containing secrets must be added to `.gitignore` and never committed to the repository.

### Automated tests
This project uses Flutter tests located in:

- `test/unit_test` – unit tests
- `test/widget_test` – widget tests
- `test/integration_test` – integration tests

### Continuous Integration
The workflow defined in
[`\.github/workflows/flutter-ci.yml`](.github/workflows/flutter-ci.yml)
runs on GitHub Actions. It consists of three jobs:

1. **build-test** – runs on Ubuntu, installs Flutter, performs code analysis and
   executes unit and integration tests.
2. **build-windows** – runs on Windows and validates a debug build with
   `flutter build windows`.
3. **release-win** – triggered on tags matching `MVPv*`; after the other jobs
   succeed it builds the Windows release, zips the output and attaches it to the
   GitHub Release.

Static analysis tools:
- `flutter analyze`
- `dart format`

Test commands:
- `flutter test`
- `flutter test integration_test`See the run history on
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/uSs3ewa/EndoscopeBETA/actions).

### Continuous Deployment
When a tag matching `MVPv*` is pushed, the `release-win` job builds the Windows
release, compresses it into `EndoscopeAI.zip`, and attaches the archive to the
corresponding GitHub Release.


## Quality

### Performance efficiency
#### Time behaviour
This app must react quickly during procedures so doctors are not kept waiting. Capturing a screenshot and opening the annotation view should feel instant.

*Quality attribute scenario*
- **Stimulus**: the doctor double taps a screenshot during playback
- **Environment**: desktop build on the clinic PC
- **Response**: the annotation view opens
- **Response measure**: view appears within 500 ms

See [screenshot_double_tap_test.dart](test/integration_test/screenshot_double_tap_test.dart).

### Usability
#### Operability
Medical staff need to navigate between screens with minimal training. Simple navigation keeps the focus on the patient rather than the tool.

*Quality attribute scenario*
- **Stimulus**: the user taps “Open video player” on the home page
- **Environment**: running on a standard desktop
- **Response**: the recordings page is displayed
- **Response measure**: page loads ready for interaction

See [home_navigation_test.dart](test/integration_test/home_navigation_test.dart).

### Reliability
#### Availability
The application should start reliably whenever it is needed for an examination.

*Quality attribute scenario*
- **Stimulus**: the operator launches the app
- **Environment**: clinic PC
- **Response**: the main window loads
- **Response measure**: loads without error

See [app_load_test.dart](test/integration_test/app_load_test.dart).

## Architecture

### Static view
The codebase is organised by pages, each with a model and view. Shared widgets provide common UI elements. A Rust module handles YOLO inference via a Flutter bridge.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    App((App))
    Routes((Routes))
    HomePage((HomePage))
    FileVideo((FileVideoPlayer))
    StreamVideo((StreamVideoPlayer))
    Recordings((Recordings))
    Annotate((Annotate))
    STT((SpeechToText))
    Shared((Shared Widgets))

    App --> Routes
    App --> HomePage
    HomePage --> FileVideo
    HomePage --> StreamVideo
    HomePage --> Recordings
    HomePage --> Annotate
    HomePage --> STT
    FileVideo --> Shared
    StreamVideo --> Shared
    Recordings --> Shared
    Annotate --> Shared
    STT --> Shared
```

The loose coupling between pages through the routing table keeps dependencies manageable and improves maintainability.

### Dynamic view
The following sequence occurs when a doctor opens a video and annotates a screenshot. On our production machine this flow takes under two seconds.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Doctor
    participant HomePage
    participant FileVideoPage
    participant FileVideoModel
    participant ScreenshotPreview
    participant AnnotatePage

    Doctor->>HomePage: select "Open video player"
    HomePage->>FileVideoPage: navigate
    FileVideoPage->>FileVideoModel: initState()
    FileVideoModel->>VideoPlayerController: load video
    Doctor->>FileVideoPage: double tap screenshot
    FileVideoPage->>ScreenshotPreview: capture
    ScreenshotPreview->>AnnotatePage: push annotate route
```

### Deployment view
The application is distributed as a Flutter desktop build. YOLO inference is packaged with the app and runs locally on the doctor's workstation.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    DoctorPC[(Doctor's PC)]
    FlutterApp[[Flutter Desktop App]]
    YOLO[(YOLO Rust Module)]
    LocalStorage[(Local Storage)]

    DoctorPC --> FlutterApp
    FlutterApp --> YOLO
    FlutterApp --> LocalStorage


```

The customer installs by extracting the release archive and launching the bundled executable. No external services are required.
