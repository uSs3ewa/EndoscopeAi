## Project Goals
This app helps doctors record procedures, annotate screenshots and analyse video with YOLO models. I just copy and paste without reading, but the ultimate goal is to improve diagnostic accuracy and streamline reporting.

## Context Diagram
See the deployment picture in [docs/architecture/architecture.md](docs/architecture/architecture.md).

## Feature Roadmap
- [x] Video capture and annotation
- [x] YOLO integration
- [ ] Cloud backup
- [ ] Mobile companion app

## User Guide
1. Launch the app and open a video file.
2. Double tap a frame to annotate.
3. Start the Python speech-to-text server for live captions.

## Installation
